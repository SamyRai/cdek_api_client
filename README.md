## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cdek_api_client'
```

And then execute:

```sh
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
gem install cdek_api_client
```

## Usage

### Initialization

To use the CDEK API Client, you need to initialize it with your CDEK API credentials (client ID and client secret):

```ruby
require 'cdek_api_client'

client_id = 'your_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'

client = CDEKApiClient::Client.new(client_id, client_secret)
```

### Creating an Order

To create an order, you need to create the necessary entities (`OrderData`, `Recipient`, `Sender`, `Package`, and `Item`) and then pass them to the `create_order` method of the `Order` class:

```ruby
recipient = CDEKApiClient::Entities::Recipient.new(
  name: 'John Doe',
  phones: [{ number: '+79000000000' }],
  email: 'johndoe@example.com'
)

sender = CDEKApiClient::Entities::Sender.new(
  name: 'Sender Name',
  phones: [{ number: '+79000000001' }],
  email: 'sender@example.com'
)

item = CDEKApiClient::Entities::Item.new(
  name: 'Item 1',
  ware_key: '00055',
  payment: 1000,
  cost: 1000,
  weight: 500,
  amount: 1
)

package = CDEKApiClient::Entities::Package.new(
  number: '1',
  weight: 500,
  length: 10,
  width: 10,
  height: 10,
  comment: 'Package 1',
  items: [item]
)

order_data = CDEKApiClient::Entities::OrderData.new(
  type: 1,
  number: 'TEST123',
  tariff_code: 1,
  comment: 'Test order',
  recipient: recipient,
  sender: sender,
  from_location: { code: 44 },
  to_location: { code: 270 },
  packages: [package]
)

order_client = CDEKApiClient::Order.new(client)

begin
  order_response = order_client.create(order_data)
  puts "Order created successfully: #{order_response}"
rescue => e
  puts "Error creating order: #{e.message}"
end
```

### Tracking an Order

To track an order, use the `track` method of the `Order` class with the order UUID:

```ruby
order_uuid = 'order_uuid_from_created_order_response'

begin
  tracking_info = order_client.track(order_uuid)
  puts "Tracking info: #{tracking_info}"
rescue => e
  puts "Error tracking order: #{e.message}"
end
```

### Calculating Tariff

To calculate the tariff, use the `calculate` method of the `Tariff` class with the necessary tariff data:

```ruby
tariff_data = CDEKApiClient::Entities::TariffData.new(
  type: 1,
  currency: 'RUB',
  from_location: { code: 44 },
  to_location: { code: 137 },
  packages: [{ weight: 500, length: 10, width: 10, height: 10 }]
)

tariff_client = CDEKApiClient::Tariff.new(client)

begin
  tariff_response = tariff_client.calculate(tariff_data)
  puts "Tariff calculated: #{tariff_response}"
rescue => e
  puts "Error calculating tariff: #{e.message}"
end
```

### Getting Location Data

To retrieve location data such as cities and regions supported by CDEK, use the `cities` and `regions` methods of the `Location` class:

```ruby
location_client = CDEKApiClient::Location.new(client)

# Fetching cities
begin
  cities = location_client.cities
  puts "Cities: #{cities}"
rescue => e
  puts "Error fetching cities: #{e.message}"
end

# Fetching regions
begin
  regions = location_client.regions
  puts "Regions: #{regions}"
rescue => e
  puts "Error fetching regions: #{e.message}"
end
```

### Setting Up Webhooks

Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications about various events related to your shipments. To set up a webhook, register a URL where CDEK will send HTTP POST requests with event data:

```ruby
webhook_client = CDEKApiClient::Webhook.new(client)

webhook_url = 'https://yourapp.com/webhooks/cdek'
begin
  response = webhook_client.register(webhook_url, event_types: ['ORDER_STATUS', 'DELIVERY_STATUS'])
  puts "Webhook registered: #{response}"
rescue => e
  puts "Error registering webhook: #{e.message}"
end
```

To retrieve and delete registered webhooks:

```ruby
# Fetching webhooks
begin
  webhooks = webhook_client.get_webhooks
  puts "Webhooks: #{webhooks}"
rescue => e
  puts "Error fetching webhooks: #{e.message}"
end

# Deleting a webhook
webhook_id = 'webhook_id_to_delete'
begin
  response = webhook_client.delete(webhook_id)
  puts "Webhook deleted: #{response}"
rescue => e
  puts "Error deleting webhook: #{e.message}"
end
```

### Fetching Location Data

The gem has pre-cached values and uses them by default. Users can override this behavior by fetching live data.

You can fetch cities, regions, offices, and postal code data directly from CDEK API.

```ruby

# Fetching cities
begin
  cities = location_client.cities(use_live_data: true)
rescue => e
  puts "Error fetching cities: #{e.message}"
end

# Fetching regions
begin
  regions = location_client.regions(use_live_data: true)
rescue => e
  puts "Error fetching regions: #{e.message}"
end

# Fetching  offices
begin
  offices = location_client.offices(use_live_data: true)
rescue => e
  puts "Error fetching offices: #{e.message}"
end

# Fetching postal codes for each city
begin
  cities = location_client.cities(use_live_data: true)
rescue => e
  puts "Error fetching postal codes: #{e.message}"
end
```

### Order Management

The gem provides comprehensive order management capabilities beyond basic creation and tracking:

```ruby
# Delete an order
begin
  response = client.order.delete('order-uuid')
  puts "Order deleted: #{response}"
rescue => e
  puts "Error deleting order: #{e.message}"
end

# Cancel an order (refusal)
begin
  response = client.order.cancel('order-uuid')
  puts "Order canceled: #{response}"
rescue => e
  puts "Error canceling order: #{e.message}"
end

# Update an order
updated_order_data = # ... create updated order data
begin
  response = client.order.update(updated_order_data)
  puts "Order updated: #{response}"
rescue => e
  puts "Error updating order: #{e.message}"
end

# Get order by UUID

end

# Get order by IM number
begin
  order_info = client.order.get_by_im_number('ORDER123')
  puts "Order info: #{order_info}"
rescue => e

end

# Create client return order
client_return_data = CDEKApiClient::Entities::OrderData.new(
  type: 1,
  tariff_code: 1,
  packages: [package]
)
begin
  response = client.order.create_client_return('original-order-uuid', client_return_data)

## Schema Management

The gem includes a schema management system to keep API definitions up-to-date. The `pull_cdek_schemas.rb` script fetches the latest OpenAPI schemas from CDEK's documentation and organizes them.

### Pulling Latest Schemas

```ruby
# Run the schema pull script
ruby pull_cdek_schemas.rb

# This will:
# 1. Fetch API documentation from CDEK
# 2. Parse and organize schemas
# 3. Save to cdek_api_schemas.json
# 4. Display analysis of available endpoints
```

### Schema Analysis

The script analyzes and organizes:
- **5 main API schemas** from CDEK documentation
- **40 unique endpoints** across all schemas
- Complete endpoint mapping with HTTP methods
- Metadata for each schema version

### Automated Updates

Run the schema pull script periodically to stay updated with the latest CDEK API changes:

```bash
# Add to cron or CI/CD pipeline
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/gem && ruby pull_cdek_schemas.rb
```

## TODO List

- [x] Restructure the codebase for better organization.
- [x] Add mappings for CDEK internal codes.
- [x] Add more API endpoints and data entities (Order management, Print/Documents, Courier services, Payment services).
- [x] Implement schema management system.
- [x] Add comprehensive documentation in English, Russian, and Tatar.
- [ ] Check all attributes for required and optional fields.
- [x] Add documentation for all classes and methods.
- [ ] Refine entity validations.
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling.
- [ ] Add rate limiting support.
